iphone 5/SE configuration: detailedproduct content goes outside of boxes.

things to consider
- information in about page and profile could be more so the text wont be too close to the edge
- can have the main content in the profile page (profile left and right) to be centred in the page, so profile-right would not take up too much space, hence a lot of blank space
- in normal mode, when scroll down and scroll back up, the header would not re-appear
- can consider putting links in the shop by club in home page, that navigate to the catalog page
- in catalog page, the height of the sort box may be too high
- image in detailed product page were not able to resize when the screen gets too small, ie iPhone 5 size, t-shirt would be out of bound
- there is no scrolling for header in shipping and payment page
