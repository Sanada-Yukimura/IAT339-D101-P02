iphone 5/SE configuration: detailedproduct content goes outside of boxes.

things to consider
- information in about page and profile could be more so the text wont be too close to the edge


- image in detailed product page were not able to resize when the screen gets too small, ie iPhone 5 size, t-shirt would be out of bound
- sort list in catalog may become too narrow in mobile version
- choose size in detail product list becomes too narrow in mobile version
- text go out of box in about page when window size gone narrower
- text go out of the box in product reviews in detailed product list



new

- the width of sort in catalog page (at about 1000px wide) maybe too narrow
